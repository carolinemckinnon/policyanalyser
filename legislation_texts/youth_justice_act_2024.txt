(h)	any other matter the Court considers appropriate.
(2)	In considering the matters in subsection (1), the Children's Court may inform itself in any way it considers appropriate.
197	Extension of adjournment
(1)	Despite anything to the contrary in section 193, the Children's Court may adjourn a criminal proceeding for a further period not exceeding 2 months if it considers the adjournment to be appropriate to enable the completion of the diversion program.
(2)	The total period of the adjournment under section 193(1) and subsection (1) must not exceed 6 months.
198	Conclusion of the diversion program
(1)	If a child completes a diversion program to the satisfaction of the Children's Court—
(a)	no plea to the charge is to be taken, or if a plea to the charge was withdrawn under section 193(4), no further plea to the charge is to be taken; and
(b)	the Court must discharge the child without any finding of guilt; and
(c)	the fact of participation in the diversion program is not to be treated as a finding of guilt except for the purposes of—
(i)	Division 1 of Part 3 and Part 10 of the Confiscation Act 1997; and
(ii)	section 9 of the Control of Weapons Act 1990; and
(iii)	section 151 of the Firearms Act 1996; and
(iv)	Part 4 of the Sentencing Act 1991; and
(d)	the fact of participation in the diversion program and the discharge of the child is a defence to a later charge for the same offence or a similar offence arising out of the same circumstances.
(2)	If a child does not complete a diversion program to the satisfaction of the Children's Court and the child is subsequently found guilty of the charge, the Court must take into account the extent to which the child complied with the diversion program when sentencing the child.
199	Diversion program and community service activities
If an adjournment is granted under section 193(1) and the diversion program requires a person to engage in community service activities—
(a)	for the purposes of the Accident Compensation Act 1985 and the Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2013 or any other Act or law, the child or young person is taken to be a worker employed by the Crown; and
(b)	for the purposes of the Accident Compensation Act 1985 and the Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2013, the weekly earnings of the child or young person are to be taken to be—
(i)	an amount equivalent to the weekly earnings of the child or young person in any full-time employment in which the child or young person is engaged at that time; or
(ii)	if the child or young person is not engaged in full-time employment at that time, an amount which the Minister administering the Accident Compensation Act 1985 and the Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2013 considers reasonable in the circumstances of the case; and
(c)	the child or young person is not entitled to receive any remuneration in respect of any work performed in those community service activities.

Nothing in this Part affects the requirement to observe the rules of natural justice.
Part 6.4—Standard of proof
201	Proof beyond reasonable doubt
(1)	On the summary hearing of a charge for an offence, whether indictable or summary, the Children's Court must be satisfied of a child's guilt on proof beyond reasonable doubt by relevant and admissible evidence.
Note
See also section 141 of the Evidence Act 2008.
(2)	If the Court is not satisfied in accordance with subsection (1), it must dismiss the charge.
Chapter 7—Sentencing
Part 7.1—Sentencing principles
202	Court must have regard to sentencing principles and general common law principles or rules in sentencing a child
(1)	In sentencing a child for an offence, a court, as far as is reasonably practicable and appropriate in the circumstances, must have regard to—
(a)	the sentencing principles, to the extent that each principle is relevant; and
(b)	subject to subsections (2) and (3), the general common law principles or rules applicable to the sentencing of children.
Note
A court is not to take into account the guiding youth justice principles in sentencing a child—see section 17(2).
(2)	In the event of inconsistency between any of the sentencing principles and the general common law principles or rules applicable to the sentencing of children, the sentencing principles take precedence to the extent of the inconsistency.
(3)	The common law principle of general deterrence does not apply to the sentencing of a child under this Act.
203	Sentencing principle—rehabilitation and positive development
A sentence imposed on a child should give the highest priority to the rehabilitation and positive development of the child, including by—
(a)	preserving and strengthening the child's relationship with the child's parents, family and persons of significance in the child's life; and
(b)	supporting the child to live at home, or in safe, stable and secure living arrangements in the community; and
(c)	promoting the social and emotional wellbeing of the child through responses that—
(i)	develop the child's strengths; and
(ii)	address any underlying issues that may contribute to the child's offending behaviour; and
(d)	promoting the child's access to and participation in education, training or work, and allowing education, training or work to continue with minimal interruption or disturbance; and
(e)	promoting the participation of the child in other activities that will support the child's positive development, including community, recreation and sport, music, and artistic activities; and
(f)	minimising any stigma resulting from the sentence; and
(g)	recognising that children often have limited control over their environment and having regard to the important role that public service bodies, public entities, Victoria Police, non-government organisations and the community can fulfil to collaboratively support the child's successful completion of the sentence.
204	Sentencing principle—protection of the community from reoffending
A sentence imposed on a child should protect the community from any further offending by the child, noting that efforts to support rehabilitation and positive development are the most effective ways to reduce reoffending.
205	Sentencing principle—individual characteristics and vulnerabilities
A sentence imposed on a child should—
(a)	be tailored to the individual characteristics of the child, such as the following—
(i)	age, maturity and stage of development;
(ii)	gender or gender identity;
(iii)	sexual orientation;
(iv)	Aboriginal identity;
(v)	cultural, racial or other identity and sense of belonging;
(vi)	religion;
(vii)	disability and associated support needs;
(viii)	mental health and other health needs;
(ix)	any other relevant characteristics; and
(b)	recognise the vulnerabilities and strengths of the child, having regard to—
(i)	the individual characteristics of the child, including any interrelationship of those characteristics; and
(ii)	any relevant experiences including abuse, trauma, neglect, loss, family violence or child protection involvement, including removal from family or placement in out of home care.
206	Sentencing principle—responsibility for action
A sentence imposed on a child should ensure that the child is aware that they must bear a responsibility for any action they take which is against the law.
207	Sentencing principle—impact on victims
A sentence imposed on a child should—
(a)	recognise the impact of the child's offending on any victim of that offending; and
(b)	provide opportunities for the child to restore any harm caused by their offending; and
(c)	take into account any steps the child has taken to restore such harm, to the extent that the child has the capacity to do so.
208	Sentencing principle—minimum intervention
A sentence imposed on a child should be the minimum intervention required in the circumstances, with a custodial sentence imposed as a last resort and for the minimum period appropriate and necessary.
Note
Section 324 prevents the Children's Court from imposing a sentence of detention on a child who was under 14 years of age at the time of the offending unless the offence is a Category A serious youth offence, a Category B serious youth offence or any other offence the Court considers to be a serious and violent offence and the Court is reasonably satisfied that the child presents a serious risk to community safety.
209	Sentencing principle—deterrence from committing offences in youth justice custodial centre
A sentence imposed on a child should deter the child from committing offences while held in custody in a youth justice custodial centre, if relevant.
210	Additional sentencing principles for Aboriginal children
In addition to the other sentencing principles, a sentence imposed on an Aboriginal child should—
(a)	support the social and emotional wellbeing of the child; and
(b)	promote the healing of the child; and
(c)	strengthen the child's connection to family, kin, community, culture, Country and Elders; and
(d)	support the right of Aboriginal persons to self-determination by—
(i)	providing the child with an opportunity to express their views; and
(ii)	promoting the participation of the child and family, kin and Elders in the sentencing process; and
Example
A submission made under section 221 in relation to the unique systemic and background factors affecting the child, for the purpose of assisting the Children's Court in determining what sentence to impose on the child, is an example of the way that the right of Aboriginal persons to self-determination may be supported.
(e)	pay particular attention to the history, culture and circumstances of the child; and
(f)	recognise that discriminatory systemic institutional and historical factors have resulted in Aboriginal children being over-represented in the criminal justice system, particularly in custody; and
(g)	reflect the need to reduce inequality and the resultant over-representation of Aboriginal children in the criminal justice system.
Note
Section 325(3)(e) requires the Children's Court to provide reasons outlining how it has had regard to the sentencing principles in this section if the Court imposes a custodial sentence on an Aboriginal child.
Part 7.2—Reports and other matters to be taken into account in considering sentence
211	Children's Court may only consider certain reports and other matters
In determining what sentence to impose on a child for an offence, the Children's Court may take into account only the following—

The Children's Court may order a progress report in certain circumstances—see Division 9 of Part 9.2.
(k)	any information provided to the Court by the DFFH Secretary or an Aboriginal agency under Part 9.1.
212	Victim impact statements
(1)	For the purpose of assisting the Children's Court in determining what sentence to impose on a child for an offence, a victim may make a statement to the Court about—

Note
Section 218 provides that only the admissible parts of a victim impact statement may be read aloud in open court.
(4)	A victim impact statement is not inadmissible merely because it contains subjective or emotive material.
(5)	It is the intention of Parliament that in interpreting and applying this section, the Children's Court is to have regard to—
(a)	the context that a victim impact statement allows the victim to tell the Court about the impact of the offence on the victim; and
(b)	subsection (4).
215	Distribution of victim impact statement
(1)	If a victim impact statement is prepared by or on behalf of a victim, the victim must provide to the prosecutor a copy of it, including a copy of any report attached to the victim impact statement under section 213(1).
(2)	The copy is to be provided a reasonable time before sentencing is to take place.

Part 7.3—Deferral of sentencing
222	Children's Court may defer sentencing
(1)	The Children's Court may defer sentencing a child found guilty of an offence if—
(a)	the Court is of the opinion that in the interests of the child sentencing should be deferred; and
(b)	the deferral is for one or more of the reasons set out in subsection (2); and
(c)	the child consents to the deferral of sentencing.
(2)	Sentencing may be deferred for one or more of the following reasons—
(a)	to allow the child to demonstrate positive development or rehabilitation;
(b)	to allow the child to participate in activities or programs that support the child's positive development or rehabilitation, including through supervision by the Secretary;
(c)	to allow the child to participate in a youth justice planning meeting if the Children's Court is considering making a youth supervision and support order or a youth control order;
Note
See sections 275 and 282 for requirements relating to ordering a youth justice planning meeting.
(d)	to allow the child to participate in a pre-sentence group conference if the Children's Court is considering making a community service order, probation order, youth supervision and support order, youth control order or youth justice custodial order and—
(i)	the Court is of the opinion, after consultation with the Secretary, that the child is suitable to participate in the conference; and
(ii)	the child consents to participate in the conference;
(e)	to provide the child an opportunity to receive a reduced sentence if the child demonstrates positive engagement during the deferral period;
(f)	the Children's Court otherwise considers it appropriate.
(3)	If the Children's Court defers sentencing, it must advise the child that when the Court later sentences the child, the Court must have regard to—
(a)	the child's behaviour during the period of deferral; and
(b)	any applicable matters set out in section 227(4)(b), (c), (d) or (e) and advise the child of those matters.
(4)	The Children's Court must not defer sentencing for the sole purpose of obtaining a pre-sentence report or any other report.
(5)	However, if the Children's Court has deferred sentencing, nothing in this section prevents the Court ordering a pre-sentence report in accordance with Division 3 of Part 9.2.
223	Pre-sentence group conference or youth justice planning meeting to be held if sentencing deferred
(1)	If the Children's Court defers sentencing under section 222 to allow the child to participate in a pre-sentence group conference, the Court must order that a pre-sentence group conference be held in accordance with Part 7.4.
Note
Part 7.4 and Divisions 1 and 4 of Part 9.2 set out requirements in relation to pre-sentence group conferences and pre-sentence group conference reports.
(2)	If the Children's Court defers sentencing under section 222 to allow the child to participate in a youth justice planning meeting, the Court must order that a youth justice planning meeting be held in accordance with Division 6 of Part 7.8.
Note
Division 6 of Part 7.8 sets out the requirements and purposes of a youth justice planning meeting and Divisions 1 and 7 of Part 9.2 set out requirements in relation to youth justice planning meeting reports.
224	Adjourning deferred sentence and period of deferral
(1)	Subject to subsection (2), if the Children's Court defers sentencing a child under section 222, the Court must adjourn the case to a fixed date for sentence and release the child—
(a)	unconditionally; or
(b)	on bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1977.
(2)	If the Children's Court is considering making a youth justice custodial order and the deferral of the sentence is to allow the child to participate in a pre-sentence group conference, the Court must adjourn the case to a fixed date for sentence and—
(a)	release the child unconditionally; or
(b)	release the child on bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1977; or
(c)	remand the child in custody for a period not exceeding 21 clear days.
(3)	The period for which sentencing may be deferred is—
(a)	if the child is remanded in custody under subsection (2)(c), a period not exceeding 2 months; or
(b)	otherwise, a period not exceeding 4 months.
(4)	If a child is brought before the Children's Court on the expiry of a period of remand ordered under subsection (2)(c), the Court must not remand the child in custody for a further period exceeding 21 clear days.
(5)	Bail must not be refused to a child on the sole ground that the child does not have any, or any adequate, accommodation.
Notes
1	The guiding youth justice principle set out in section 19(a) requires responses to offending by a child to focus on prevention, diversion and minimum intervention by ensuring that the child is subject to the minimum intervention that is necessary and appropriate in the circumstances with any deprivation of liberty being a last resort and for the minimum period appropriate.
2	There is a presumption in favour of proceeding by summons if an accused is a child, unless it would be clearly inappropriate to do so—see section 147(1).
225	Application by child for hearing of adjourned case at short notice
(1)	A child in respect of whom sentencing has been deferred under section 222 may apply to the Children's Court for the adjourned case to be re-listed at short notice.
(2)	The Children's Court must cause a notice of an application under subsection (1) setting out the grounds of the application to be given to—
(a)	the informant; and
(b)	the Secretary, if appropriate.
(3)	On an application under subsection (1), the Children's Court may re-list the adjourned case at short notice if the Court considers it appropriate to do so.

(a)	sentence the child; or
(b)	further adjourn the case to a date fixed for sentence and exercise any of the powers under section 224(1) or (2) (as the case requires).
(3)	If the Children's Court further defers sentencing the child under subsection (2), the total period of all deferrals of the sentencing must not exceed 2 months.
(4)	In determining what sentence to impose on the child, the Children's Court must have regard to—
(a)	the child's behaviour during the period of deferral; and
(b)	any pre-sentence report ordered under Division 3 of Part 9.2; and
(c)	if the child participated in a pre-sentence group conference, the fact of that participation and the pre-sentence group conference report; and
(d)	if the child participated in a youth justice planning meeting, the fact of that participation and the youth justice planning meeting report; and

Note
See section 238 for the effect on sentence of participation in a pre-sentence group conference.
(5)	If the child does not appear before the Children's Court on the date fixed for sentence or for the hearing of the adjourned case, a magistrate constituting the Court may issue a warrant to arrest the child.
