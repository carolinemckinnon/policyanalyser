Inter-personal conflict,"Inter-personal conflict means when a person or group of people repeatedly interfere with each other's workplace goals, preferences, values and interests through behaviours which cause workplace harm. Inter-personal conflict may arise from (but is not limited to): differing personalities differing communication and/or leadership styles differences in ideas, decisions and/or actions lack of respect. Continued inappropriate inter-personal conflict can form a pattern of unreasonable behaviour that may be considered bullying (see Definition above). Not all inter-personal conflict is accompanied by harmful behaviour. Meaningful conflict, such as debate, disagreement, constructive feedback and discussion regarding different approaches to work and goals, is a useful and healthy part of the workplace that enables teams to be more creative and ensure quality of service.",173,
Predatory behaviour,"Predatory behaviour is where a person misuses their authority or influence with the intention of exploiting another employee for sexual or other personal gratification. It is often preceded by grooming behaviours. Predatory behaviour is sexual harassment under this policy (see Definition below). Examples of predatory behaviour A senior person using their authority and influence to try to manipulate or pressure a junior employee into a sexual relationship. A People Development Command (PDC) staff member or a supervisor using their authority and influence which comes with the role of instructor or assessor to manipulate or pressure recruits or probationary constables at designated training workplaces into sexual activity or tolerating sexualised behaviour. These examples may involve 'consensual' sex or 'welcome' sexual advances, but the power imbalance and circumstances mean that the behaviour is improper.",173,
Reasonable management action,"Reasonable management action includes (but is not limited to) situations where a person is subjected to or is affected by reasonable and legitimate: strong management that is clear, firm, direct and respectful performance management processes feedback or advice about work-related behaviour and conduct preliminary inquiries into a complaint investigation and disciplinary action application of policy rules and guidelines allocation of work responsibilities or duties decisions regarding transfer and promotion decisions regarding access to training, conferences or work-related travel. Managers have fundamental rights to define and monitor how work is performed, provided the action is taken in a reasonable manner. For example, feedback or counselling which is objective and includes actions required to remedy deficiencies is reasonable. By contrast, comments that fail to provide adequate guidance as to required standards, or performance counselling that does not include actions to remedy the deficiencies, may amount to management action taken in an unreasonable manner. An injury arising from reasonable management action taken in a reasonable manner is not compensable under the Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2013.",173,Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2013
Sexual harassment,"A person sexually harasses another person if he or she makes an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome request for sexual favours, to the other person; or engages in any other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the other person, in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the other person would be offended, humiliated or intimidated (Section 92 of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010). Examples of sexual harassment Sexual harassment refers to any behaviours - physical, written or verbal - that has a sexual connotation such as: sexually suggestive comments or jokes comments about someone's body or physical appearance subjecting a person to an act of physical intimacy e.g. brushing up against them, touching, or hugging sexually suggestive behaviour e.g. requests for sex or comments with sexual connotations sexually suggestive comments or jokes making gestures or actions of a sexual nature e.g. offensive hand or body gestures inappropriate staring or leering sexually explicit or suggestive images, messages via email, SMS, social media displaying sexually suggestive or pornographic images e.g. on screen savers, photo calendars intrusive questions about someone's personal life (including their sex life) or physical appearance sexual harassment includes predatory behaviour and grooming (see Definitions above). Some types of sexual harassment can also be a criminal offence. A single act or continuing courses of conduct are equally capable of constituting sexual harassment. The intent of the harasser is not relevant. Sexual harassment may also meet the definition of discrimination under the Equal Opportunity Act. This will depend on the circumstances. For example, if the workplace culture is hostile to women, this may be both sexual harassment and sex discrimination. This is because harassing conduct may result in a woman being subject to unfavourable treatment in employment. What is not sexual harassment? Behaviour which is based on mutual attraction, friendship and respect, and which is consensual, welcome and reciprocated, is not sexual harassment. However, some sexualised behaviours and sexual relationships in the workplace, even if welcome and consensual, are inappropriate for other reasons: the sexualised behaviour may create a hostile working environment for other people based on their gender and may be discrimination a relationship may be a conflict of interest if a person's personal interests influence, or appear to influence, the impartial performance of their duties e.g. as a supervisor or assessor (see VPM Conflict of interest) some workplace relationships are not appropriate, even if consensual and welcome, because of the special power and responsibility in the professional role e.g. Academy Instructors must not have sexual relationships with recruits, students or probationary employees, Welfare Officers must not have sexual relationships with people they are supporting using work time or resources to pursue a personal relationship, or engaging in sexual activity on work time or at work premises is misconduct some kinds of sexualised behaviour may be grooming behaviour (see Definition above).",173,Equal Opportunity Act 2010
Victimisation,"Victimisation means subjecting, or threatening to subject, someone to something detrimental because they have asserted their legal rights, made or intend to make a complaint, helped someone else to make a complaint, or refused to do something because it would be discrimination, sexual harassment or victimisation.
